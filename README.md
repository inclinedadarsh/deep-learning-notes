# Deep Learning Notes

## Overview

These are some deep learning notes I have been making while learning deep learning concepts. These are based on concepts, formulas and graphs.

I have made these while learning through some course or YouTube videos or while making some project.

## Sections

Notes are divided into two sections:

* **Notes by Topics**: In this section, I have made notes on individual sections. These are most probably from YouTube videos.
* **Deeplearning.ai notes**: All notes in this section are from the Deeplearning.ai's Specialization on Deep Learning.
