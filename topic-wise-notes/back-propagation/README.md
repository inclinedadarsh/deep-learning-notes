# Back Propagation

These notes are from the video series of [CampusX YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@campusx-official)' playlist: [100 Days of Deep Learning](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16\_RmvYuZauWaPlRTC54KxSNLtNn\&si=ytwvd2InN9ECzXVX). I have just written these for myself and for others to refer in future.&#x20;

In this notes, we'll have a try to understand what is back propagation. You can find the first video of the series [here](https://youtu.be/6M1wWQmcUjQ?si=oOpHrJXlibxDZyYU).

Prerequisites:

* Forward propagation
* Gradient descent
* Notations: [https://youtu.be/H0\_3SJh4Rqs?si=G6mu8dLpMmjcVt68](https://youtu.be/H0\_3SJh4Rqs?si=G6mu8dLpMmjcVt68)

Notes are divided into 2 parts:

* [What is back propagation?](what-is-back-propagation.md)
* [How does it work?](how-does-it-work.md)
